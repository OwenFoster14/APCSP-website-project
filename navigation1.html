            <h1>Collector's Anxiety</h1>
            <small>heheheheh</small>
            <p>Hey guys, PointCrow here, do you ever get collectors anxiety in HUGE open-world RPGs? Where there’s so much to do, so much to grab, you’re just wondering if that ONE item that you pick up is the ONLY item of its kind? Well look no further, the least qualified person for the job is ready to tell you ALL of the items that you should hold on to in Breath of the Wild, because you won’t be able to get them again once you use them up. And if you like this video, and it helps you, give it a like or share this video with your friends because you never know who else it might help out. That, and give the subscribe button a look if you wanna be notified when another one of these videos comes out. Alright, let’s get right into it and I’ll attempt to make it short and sweet <3.

                Every item lying around in the open world will respawn no matter what when a Blood Moon rises, it’s basically a complete world reset. However, items in treasure chest can only be obtained once. It’s also the same with Quest rewards. Once you completed that task, you can’t complete it again.

                Starting off, we have the Forest Dweller’s Sword. It’s found in a chest near Mido’s Swamp, a chest near the Hyrule Garrison Ruins, and a chest under the bridge near Lake Floria. It’s also given as a Quest reward for completing the Test of Wood in the Korok Forest.

                It’s important to note, however, that while the Test of Wood does give you the Forest Dweller’s Sword the first time, for each subsequent visit after that, you have to return it after the Trial is done.

                The Kite Shield is to the Rito Warriors as the Forest Dweller’s Sword is to the Koroks. This shield can only be obtained in a chest after beating Bokoblins in the North Tabantha Snowfield, and in another chest found near Hebra Plunge. It’s also found if you manage to get the worst time in Selmie’s Shield Surfing. And if you’re anything similar to a pro gamer like me, this objective should be no problem to get. Easy.

                Speaking of pro gamer skills, I stream at twitch.tv/PointCrow. And if you don’t watch the stream, look at all the spicy content you’re missing! (Enter weird Zelda song that Crow vibes to here.)

                Moving on, there are FOUR more items on this list that are special mentions. Uhh, I’ll call these “miss-able” items, since they’re moderately obtainable until you complete a certain threshold in the game all depending on how you play. These include the regular Lynel Spear, the regular Lynel Crusher, the Mighty Lynel Spear, and the Mighty Lynel Crusher.

                As some of you may know, the enemies in Breath of the Wild get harder and level up the more you play. Red Bokoblins become blue, Blue Lizalfos become black, etc. Same thing happens with Lynels except you can’t pick up Lynel weapons in the open world, hence why they can’t respawn. You can only get a Lynel weapon from killing a Lynel, Once these Lynels are fully upgraded, as in a White Lynel or a Gold Lynel, you lose the ability to get these weapons forever.

                Enemy scaling is a completely different video, and I won’t get into how it happens in the thresholds needed to reach enemy to level up. But for the sake of this video, the more you kill, the more likely you’ll level up mobs, and the less likely you’ll be able to get these four weapons.

                It should be noted that while the Lynel weapons are missable, there is a workaround. There will always be a Red Lynel on top of a mountain in the Zora’s Domain, and a Blue Lynel in the First Gatehouse of Hyrule Castle. When killed, these do not drop their weapons, and they’re purely here for the Hyrule Compendium. However, with a small exploit, they actually will drop their weapons.

                It works simply. Start the fight, engage it, and then almost immediately afterwards, save and reload. This resets the Lynels position and you should get your parts.

                That’s it! That’s everything you need to know about the items you need to keep before they go extinct. If you like this video, give it a like, subscribe, and hey, I’m not the one to judge your life, but uhhh if you want to check out my other videos uhhhh I wouldn’t mind. Hope you have a wonderful day guys!</p>
